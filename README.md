# Basic-Linear-Regression-Understanding
Welcome to this beginner-friendly walkthrough of implementing a Basic Linear Regression Model using Python and Scikit-Learn. This notebook is a hands-on guide for anyone looking to understand how to apply simple linear regression to a dataset and interpret the results.
# Objective
->The main goal of this project is to:

->Explore the fundamentals of Simple Linear Regression

->Use Scikit-learn to train and evaluate the model

->Visualize the linear relationship between the features and the target

->Make predictions and evaluate performance using metrics like MSE and R² score
# Tools and Libraries Used
->Python 3.x

->NumPy for numerical operations

->Pandas for data manipulation

->Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization

->Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation
# Sample Output
->Linear Regression Equation: y = mx + c

->R² Score: 0.94 (indicating good fit)

->Residual plots show minimal variance, affirming model performance
